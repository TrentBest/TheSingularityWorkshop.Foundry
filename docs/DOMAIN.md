# Foundry Domain and Ownership

**Status:** the sequential workflow runner and retained in-process run lifecycle are implemented; the latest CI verification remains pending.

## The problem Foundry owns

A workflow has identifiable steps, ordering, inputs, outcomes, failure paths, and evidence explaining what happened. When that meaning is buried in CI YAML or host-specific code, it is harder to validate before execution, reuse across hosts, test independently, and explain after failure.

**Foundry owns the definition, validation, coordinated execution, retained run lifecycle, and reporting of explicit workflows.** A CI provider or application is an execution host, not the owner of the workflow's domain semantics.

## Core invariant

> **A workflow definition describes work; Foundry validates and coordinates its execution; the host supplies capabilities and decides what to do with the result.**

A definition is data, not permission to execute arbitrary code. Its meaning should be inspectable before execution, and a run should return structured outcomes rather than relying only on console text or a host-specific exit code.

## Implemented domain slice

The current runtime provides a version-1, in-memory workflow definition with ordered steps and handler keys; validation before any handler is invoked; a host-owned handler registry; sequential execution; and structured step/workflow outcomes. \`WorkflowExecutionCoordinator\` accepts work, starts a run once, exposes immutable snapshots, supports cancellation before or during execution, and waits for running handlers during asynchronous disposal.

The focused tests cover declared order, invalid definitions before side effects, handled failure with later steps skipped, cancellation, pre-cancelled runs, duplicate handler registration, accepted/running/terminal lifecycle states, cancellation, and duplicate start rejection. The current CI workflow includes the tests; a current green run is still required to verify the latest changes.

## Domain concepts and current limits

| Concept | Meaning | Current status |
|---|---|---|
| Workflow definition | Named, versioned description of intended work | Implemented as an in-memory version-1 contract |
| Step | Identified unit of work with a handler key | Implemented for sequential execution |
| Capability | Host-registered operation a step may invoke | Implemented through an explicit handler registry |
| Validation | Check the complete definition before invoking handlers | Implemented |
| Step outcome | Recorded result for one step | Implemented, including skipped work after failure/cancellation |
| Workflow outcome | Aggregate terminal result | Implemented for the current sequential runtime |
| Retained run lifecycle | Accept/start/cancel/query a run and retain state while the coordinator lives | Implemented in process; CI verification pending |
| Run identity and durable history | Correlate and retain execution attempts across process lifetime | Durable history not implemented |
| Dependency graph / parallel execution | Execute work based on graph dependencies | Not implemented |
| Retry, compensation, recovery | Policy for repeating or undoing side effects | Not implemented |
| Persisted manifest | Stable external representation and compatibility rules | Not selected or implemented |
| Timeout enforcement | Bound execution time across handlers | Not implemented by the core runtime |
| Evidence provenance and retention | Durable, queryable evidence model | Only the existing CI proof artifacts are demonstrated |

## What Foundry owns

- The workflow-definition contract and validation rules.
- Execution ordering and the semantics of success, failure, cancellation, and skipped steps within the supported runtime.
- Run identity, accepted/running/terminal lifecycle state, and immutable in-process snapshots.
- Coordination between a definition and explicitly registered capabilities.
- Structured run outcomes that hosts can interpret.
- Host-neutral behavior testable without a desktop UI or live CI provider.

## What Foundry does not own

- **Finite-state-machine primitives.** FSM_API owns those mechanics where a component directly uses that package.
- **MicroBundle composition.** FSM_COS owns its composition boundary. A Foundry workflow is not an FSM_COS RuntimeManifest, and RuntimeAssembly is not a workflow result.
- **Universal serialization.** FSM_Serialization is not presumed to provide a universal workflow schema.
- **The host environment.** GitHub Actions, AnyApp, WebPage, or another host supplies triggers, permissions, and external capabilities.
- **Arbitrary script evaluation.** Definitions cannot grant themselves environmental permissions; any future executable capability needs an explicit contract, permission boundary, and tests.
- **Presentation.** GUI, trace files, SVGs, and article renderings are views of evidence, not the source of truth.
- **Publication or deployment approval.** A successful run must not publish a NuGet package, deploy an application, or publish an article automatically.

## Relationship to neighboring Workshop technologies

A host or CI provider supplies triggers, permissions, environment, and registered capabilities. Foundry defines, validates, coordinates, and reports a workflow. GUI is an optional presentation client for the Hub: it can display run snapshots and send explicit commands through a stable adapter, but it must not own execution state or duplicate the runner.

FSM_COS remains a separate composition boundary when a workflow genuinely needs MicroBundle composition; it is not assumed to be the workflow executor. WebPage's process-group scheduling and legacy FSM ticks remain distinct until caller and test evidence proves which behaviors can be adapted safely. Foundry's current sequential runtime does not depend on FSM_COS, and no cross-repository integration should be added without a demonstrated requirement.

## Safety and correctness invariants

- Invalid definitions are rejected before any handler is invoked.
- Every step handler must be registered by the host.
- Definitions cannot grant themselves environmental permissions.
- Failure and cancellation are distinct; later work is skipped after either terminates the sequential run.
- The runtime does not report success when required work fails or does not run.
- Failure reporting avoids exposing exception messages that might contain secrets.
- Cancellation is cooperative; handlers must honor their tokens.
- Presentation snapshots are observational; commands pass through the coordinator.
- External publication and deployment remain disabled unless explicitly authorized.

These invariants are scoped to the current implementation and its tests. Durable run history, retries, compensation, enforced timeouts, and cross-process orchestration remain outside the implemented contract.

## Next verification and theory work

The immediate gate is a current CI result for the coordinator and runner tests. Then trace WebPage's real Hub callers and tests to identify which behaviors are actual workflows, host-scheduled work, or legacy group ticks. Preserve behavior before migrating it behind Foundry. The next useful theory topics are execution lifecycle and isolation, capability security, failure/cancellation semantics, evidence provenance, and a persisted representation only when a concrete interchange use case justifies it.

Theory documentation should grow alongside tested contracts, not ahead of them. Every claimed capability must point to the source or tests that verify it.
