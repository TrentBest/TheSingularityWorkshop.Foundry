# Foundry Contract Inspection Ledger

**Inspection date:** 2026-10-23  
**Branch:** `development`  
**Purpose:** Record what has actually been read before choosing Foundry contracts. This is an evidence ledger, not a claim of integration.

## Findings from source and project files

| Repository / file | Verified evidence | Implication for Foundry |
|---|---|---|
| [FSM_API `FSMBuilder.cs`](https://github.com/TrentBest/FSM_API/blob/master/FSM_API/FSMBuilder.cs) | Fluent `State`, `WithInitialState`, `Transition`, and `BuildDefinition` methods exist. | Use the actual builder API if a prototype demonstrates it fits; do not invent a second FSM syntax first. |
| [FSM_API `IStateContext.cs`](https://github.com/TrentBest/FSM_API/blob/master/FSM_API/IStateContext.cs) | Contexts implement `IContext` and provide mutable `IsValid`. | A Foundry execution context must satisfy the actual context contract if bound to FSM_API. |
| [FSM_API `FSMHandle.cs`](https://github.com/TrentBest/FSM_API/blob/master/FSM_API/FSMHandle.cs) | `FSMHandle.Update(...)` steps the instance; `CurrentState` is observable. `TransitionTo` forces transitions. | The executor must deliberately choose and test its stepping semantics. Do not assume the group tick is the only way to advance a handle. |
| [FSM_API `FSM_API.Create.cs`](https://github.com/TrentBest/FSM_API/blob/master/FSM_API/FSM_API.Create.cs) | Definitions and instances are registered through static `FSM_API.Create` methods; creation binds an `IStateContext` and processing group. | Static registry lifetime, naming collisions, cleanup, and repeat-run isolation need explicit prototype tests. |
| [FSM_API project file](https://github.com/TrentBest/FSM_API/blob/master/FSM_API/FSM_API.csproj) | Multi-targets .NET; package ID is `TheSingularityWorkshop.FSM_API`, version shown in source is 1.0.13, with no explicit package references in the project file. | Prefer the published package for a small consumer proof unless a specific test requires source linkage. |
| [FSM_API CI workflow](https://github.com/TrentBest/FSM_API/blob/master/.github/workflows/dotnet.yml) | Builds/tests the solution and packs artifacts; publishing job is gated and currently has an additional false condition. | Foundry CI should be independently verifiable; never infer that a green package workflow means Foundry is tested. |
| [FSM_COS `FsmCos.cs`](https://github.com/TrentBest/TheSingularityWorkshop.FSM_COS/blob/master/src/FSM_COS/FsmCos.cs) | `Execute(RuntimeManifest, ...)` resolves versioned MicroBundles, loads them, arbitrates up to a configured limit (default 10), and returns `RuntimeAssembly`; missing bundles, conflicts, cycles, and non-convergence fail. | FSM_COS is a composition subsystem, not a general step runner. Add it only when a workflow actually needs MicroBundle composition. |
| [FSM_COS `RuntimeManifest.cs`](https://github.com/TrentBest/TheSingularityWorkshop.FSM_COS/blob/master/src/FSM_COS/RuntimeManifest.cs) | Manifest names root MicroBundles and versions, with optional context, load-plan/schedule metadata, and semantic intent. Configuration and artifact location are separate concerns. | Do not overload this manifest with Foundry workflow-step semantics. A Foundry workflow definition is a distinct contract unless a proven mapping exists. |
| [FSM_COS `RuntimeAssembly.cs`](https://github.com/TrentBest/TheSingularityWorkshop.FSM_COS/blob/master/src/FSM_COS/RuntimeAssembly.cs) | The assembly exposes loaded MicroBundles, runtime ID, arbitration round index, and optional intent. | Assembly is a handoff result, not a workflow success/result object. |
| [FSM_COS runtime boundary](https://github.com/TrentBest/TheSingularityWorkshop.FSM_COS/blob/master/docs/RUNTIME_BOUNDARY.md) | Explicitly excludes stepping FSM_API groups, host lifecycle, presentation, networking, and Experience execution. | Preserve this boundary; do not make Foundry's responsibilities depend on a false reading of FSM_COS. |
| [FSM_Serialization README](https://github.com/TrentBest/TheSingularityWorkshop.FSM_Serialization/blob/master/README.md) and [theory](https://github.com/TrentBest/TheSingularityWorkshop.FSM_Serialization/blob/master/docs/THEORY.md) | Domain types own semantic representation; package provides binary pack/unpack and stream boundaries, not a universal schema or general object-graph serializer. | Do not assume it serializes arbitrary Foundry workflows. Inspect its actual interfaces and define domain-owned representation only after the workflow contract is selected. |
| [ProtocolAi README](https://github.com/TrentBest/TheSingularityWorkshop.ProtocolAi/blob/master/README.md) | Provider-neutral deterministic vocabulary/identity; no model inference, provider SDK, or transport. | Potentially useful for identity resolution, but not a workflow executor or publishing client. |
| [GrammarAi README](https://github.com/TrentBest/TheSingularityWorkshop.GrammarAi/blob/master/README.md) | Defines deterministic grammar structure over externally owned protocol identities. | Potentially useful for structural contracts; not a parser/execution engine by assumption. |
| [AnyApp project](https://github.com/TrentBest/AnyApp/blob/master/AnyApp.csproj) and [startup source](https://github.com/TrentBest/AnyApp/blob/master/MainWindow.xaml.cs) | Windows WPF host references FSM_COS, GUI.WPF, FSM_UserIO, ProtocolAi, and GrammarAi. Startup selects a manifest, composes through FSM_COS, then manifests the result. | AnyApp is a later host candidate, not a suitable first CI dependency because it is Windows/WPF-specific. |
| [AnyApp README](https://github.com/TrentBest/AnyApp/blob/master/README.md) | Host owns Experience selection, execution, presentation, and semantic intent meaning. | Keep Foundry's core separate from desktop UI. |
| [WebApp README](https://github.com/TrentBest/TheSingularityWorkshop.WebApp/blob/master/README.md) | Documentation entry point was inspected; implementation source/project and its concrete manifest/host contracts have not yet been verified in this pass. | No claims of Foundry/WebApp compatibility until source and tests are read. |

## Important caveats

- The repository README is not proof that every described feature currently runs.
- The public package version and the default-branch source are separate evidence; validate the exact package API in the consuming prototype.
- FSM_API documentation contains different descriptions of process-rate values in different places. The prototype should use an explicitly selected stepping path and tests, rather than rely on a comment alone.
- GitHub Actions is a host/orchestrator boundary; Foundry's workflow outcome must be mapped deliberately to process exit status and artifacts.
- No Foundry runtime, manifest contract, tests, or CI execution was implemented or verified during this inspection pass.

## Decisions still open

1. What is the smallest useful workflow contract, and how is it represented without confusing it with the FSM_COS RuntimeManifest?
2. Does the first proof need only an in-process typed contract, or a persisted manifest from day one?
3. What step types are safe and useful without executing arbitrary scripts?
4. What are cancellation, timeout, retry, idempotency, and result-retention semantics?
5. How are FSM_API static definition/instance registries cleaned up between runs?
6. Does the first proof use FSM_API directly, and what tests demonstrate the adapter is a thin wrapper rather than a parallel runtime?
7. Which source-rendering strategy creates readable excerpt images without making an optional article feature a required dependency?
8. Which external publishing destination, if any, should be supported? No provider is selected.

## Next evidence-producing action

Build a small isolated prototype against the actual FSM_API package and tests. Compare a typed in-process workflow definition with a persisted-manifest path before committing to a public schema. Verify state stepping, context invalidation, failure capture, registry cleanup, repeat runs, and terminal-result mapping. Keep FSM_COS out of the prototype unless a test demonstrates a real composition requirement.
