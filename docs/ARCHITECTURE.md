# Foundry Architecture

**Status:** the FSM_API integration probe and deterministic fox/sheepdog scenario passed prior CI. A host-neutral sequential workflow runner, focused xUnit tests, and a retained in-process lifecycle coordinator are implemented on \`development\`; the current CI run must verify the latest lifecycle tests before this slice is called green.

## Purpose

Foundry is the Workshop Hub's host-neutral execution pipeline. It accepts explicit work, validates it before side effects, coordinates execution, retains lifecycle state, and reports structured outcomes. It does not own Hub presentation or FSM_COS composition.

## Responsibility boundaries

| System | Intended responsibility | Current evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Foundry | Workflow definition/validation, run lifecycle, execution coordination, result reporting | Version-1 in-memory definition, preflight validator, registered-handler runner, retained lifecycle coordinator and immutable snapshots; CI verification pending |
| The / Architect | Hub intent and human-facing coordination | Cross-repository ownership contract; Hub presentation is optional |
| GUI | Optional Hub presentation and explicit user intents | GUI issue #53 tracks presentation contract; no execution authority |
| FSM_API | FSM mechanics when directly consumed | Published 1.0.13 package restored, built, and exercised by the prior passing probe; no reusable adapter yet |
| FSM_COS | Runtime composition when supported by its implementation | Source confirms composition boundary; Foundry integration not implemented |
| FSM_Serialization | Binary representation boundary for domain-owned values | Existing package contract inspected; no Foundry format selected |
| ProtocolAi | Potential protocol/contract interoperability | Deterministic identity vocabulary; Foundry integration is future work |
| GrammarAi | Potential language grammar/representation capabilities | Deterministic grammar structure; Foundry integration is future work |
| AnyApp / WebPage / headless CI | Potential execution hosts and adapters | WebPage is the current Hub behavior reference; migration is not yet proven |

## Workflow execution and retained lifecycle

The existing \`WorkflowRunner\` remains the only sequential workflow executor. It validates the entire definition against the host-owned handler registry, runs steps in declared order, and returns structured step/workflow outcomes.

\`WorkflowExecutionCoordinator\` adds the Hub-facing lifecycle around that runner:

- Accept a definition without executing it.
- Start an accepted run exactly once.
- Query an immutable snapshot containing run identity, status, timestamps, and a terminal result when available.
- Request cooperative cancellation before or during execution.
- Dispose by cancelling accepted/running work and awaiting completion.

This is an in-process, in-memory lifecycle. It is not a durable queue, scheduler, persisted run history, or cross-process transport. The coordinator does not reinterpret \`WorkflowResult\`, add retries, or turn arbitrary handlers into safe transactional operations.

## Keep neighboring concepts distinct

WebPage's Hub/process-group contracts include \`WorkDescriptor\`, \`CompletionToken\`, \`IExecutionProvider.Execute\`, and named process-group updates. FSM_COS returns a \`RuntimeAssembly\`. These contracts are not interchangeable with Foundry's \`WorkflowDefinition\` and \`WorkflowResult\`. Trace actual callers and tests before deciding whether they share any lower-level lifecycle or observation primitive.

GUI consumes presentation-facing snapshots and sends explicit commands through an adapter. It does not own the authoritative loop or runtime state. WebPage remains a behavior/reference fixture while any migration is proven through tests. FSM_COS remains the composition authority.

## Verified first state-execution slice

The \`Foundry.FsmApiProbe\` project uses the published FSM_API package to create a named FSM, assert its initial state, execute the public update path, assert the transition, and perform scoped cleanup. The \`Foundry.FoxSheepdog\` project exercises the fox/dog state sequence with scripted ticks, asserts the cross-FSM transition, and emits a TSV trace and SVG. The existing CI workflow compares repeat-run outputs byte-for-byte.

These are deterministic state-execution demonstrations, not automatically treated as Foundry workflows. The coordinator tests and deterministic state-evidence checks passed in [CI run #84](https://github.com/TrentBest/TheSingularityWorkshop.Foundry/actions/runs/40546957980).

## Safety boundaries

- Workflow input is data, not executable code.
- Do not evaluate arbitrary scripts or expressions from an untrusted manifest.
- Use least-privilege CI permissions and explicit timeouts.
- Cancellation is cooperative; a handler that ignores its token can delay shutdown.
- Do not expose raw exception messages that might contain secrets.
- Do not publish repository content, packages, or deployments automatically.
- Publication and deployment require explicit user approval.

## Cross-language direction

C#, Java, Rust, and other languages may eventually be supported through explicit language adapters and stable data contracts. A shared definition alone does not make runtimes interoperable: each execution boundary needs a defined transport/call mechanism, data representation, error model, cancellation semantics, and security model. This is a future direction, not a current feature.

## Architectural decision rule

Prefer reusing Workshop technologies where their real interfaces fit. Introduce a new reusable runtime abstraction only when a working test demonstrates a capability that cannot reasonably live in a thin host/adapter. Preserve the distinction between workflow execution, host-scheduled work, legacy process-group ticks, and composed runtime assemblies.
